## FAQ

**Can you port this to the new GameMaker / GameMaker Studio 2?**  
No. GameMaker Studio 2 lacks many room editing features like fields, custom previews, and sysInput that make GameMaker 8.2 so useful.  
Simpler versions exist, like the official [Astral Physics for GameMaker 2024+](https://gitlab.com/astralengine/astralphysics), but maintaining two versions across different GameMaker releases isn’t feasible.  

**Can you add this character?**  
No. We don’t add characters because this is a framework. Adding characters increases complexity and slows down development of new gimmicks.  
The only exception is Super Sonic, which reuses Sonic’s animations.  
You’re free to fork the project and do the changes you want.

**Can I make a game using this?**  
Yes! The license allows you to do anything you want — including commercial projects, forks, or fangames.
